# QueueSimulation

## Overview
QueueSimulation is a Python project that uses the SimPy library to simulate a multi-queue system. It models the process of customers arriving at a system and being processed through different queues, each with its service rate. The simulation is aimed at providing insights into queueing theory and system performance by calculating various metrics such as average waiting time, server utilization, and customer throughput.

## Features
- Simulation of multiple queues with distinct service rates.
- Calculation of key performance metrics: average waiting time, server utilization, and customer throughput.
- Utilization of the SimPy library for effective discrete-event simulation.
- Customizable parameters for different simulation scenarios.

## Acknowledgments
- This project is inspired by the principles of queueing theory and the need for practical, educational tools in system performance analysis.
- Special thanks to the SimPy community for their extensive documentation and support.
